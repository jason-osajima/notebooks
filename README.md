# mnist_adversarial
Generate adversarial examples for a CNN MNIST classifier

## Abstract
This project explores using an adversarial optimizer to train a CNN to generate noise that, 
when added to '2' images, will trick the CNN to classify it as a '6'. 

## Requirements
This project runs on Python 2.7.11, along with the following packages:
* numpy (version 1.12.0)
* tensorflow (version 0.12.1)
* matplotlib (version 1.5.1)
* scipy (version 0.18.1)
